1. Create a basic react/next js application
2. Connect our wallet, with a nicer connect application
3. Implement this function
```javascript
function airdropERC20(
        address tokenAddress,
        address[] calldata recipents,
        uint256[] calldata amounts,
        uint256 totalAmount
    )
``` 
# Testing with synpress is really bad for now , lots  of bugs
4. E2E testing
    1. When we connect, we see the form 
    2. When disconnected, wwe don't

# Skip to this part
5. Deploy to fleek
